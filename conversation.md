Features added:
A header that can be changed
border color 
border size 
border radius

the failed feature was simple
it was to add a working link to a website "www.trickquestionai.com"
it could not do this 
why? the website does not exist.
is this cheap? yes, but chatGPT could not check that the link itself was working and it couldn't make the link work (it told me to, but the assigment was to make ai to fail)  by making the website.
easy for humans
